      <h1>IMPORTANT MEMO FROM THE DESK OF THE CCS</h1>
      <p>WARNING. The Information is at risk. While [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] have been searching for the source of the leak, we must be extra vigilant. As members of [REDACTED], all users have the express duty to protect the sanctity and security of our plans for [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. As such, we have had to move the [REDACTED] to a more secure location in the [REDACTED] folder of the website's files. DO NOT FORGETâ€¦ you are responsible for [REDACTED], and should you fail in your duty, you shall be EX-CAT-MUNICATED. The humans cannot know of these plans, they would not understand the rightness of our cause nor the necessity of the change we bring. Be brave and swift dear members, the New Cat Order must rise!</p>
