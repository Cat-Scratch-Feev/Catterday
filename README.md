# Project Catterday by [Cat-Scratch-Feev](https://github.com/Cat-Scratch-Feev)

## Description
---
This project was created with a simple question in mind... What if social media... but for cats!

And so Project Catterday was born. More of an art piece than an application, Catterday provides vast minutes of entertainment.

And so, welcome to our page! But remember, the cats don't know you're human, and best you keep it that way, who knows what the cats are hiding, and what lengths they'd go to to keep it that way.
